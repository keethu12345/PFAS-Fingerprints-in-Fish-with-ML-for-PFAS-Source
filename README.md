# PFAS Fingerprints in Fish - Machine Learning Source Tracking
This repository contains my implementation of the integration of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substance (PFAS) fingerprints in fish with machine learning techniques to identify the PFAS source. This project is based on the work described in the article "Integration of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substance (PFAS) Fingerprints in Fish with Machine Learning for PFAS Source Tracking in Surface Water" published in ACS Publications.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to replicate and test the machine learning methods for PFAS source tracking as detailed in the original study. The analysis utilizes supervised machine learning models to classify PFAS sources based on chemical fingerprints found in fish.

Original Repository
This project is a replication with slight modifications of the original repository created by Dr. J. Stults, which can be found here.

Modifications
While the core of the implementation remains faithful to the original repository, I have made several modifications to test and improve my machine learning skills.
